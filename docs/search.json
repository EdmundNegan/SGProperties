    "text": "1 Introduction\nSingapore’s property market is often seen as an indicator of broader social and economic trends (are the young people able to afford housing, etc). Almost 80% of residents live in public housing known as Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats. These are subsidized high rise apartments that are sold on a 99-year leasehold which come with restrictions such as a minimum occupation period.\nThere is also an extremely vibrant and active private housing sector consisting of landed and non-landed properties which caters to a wealthier class of citizens. The non-landed private properties such as condominiums will be a closer comparison to HDBs rather than landed residences which are standalone houses on a plot of land instead of apartment buildings\nUnderstanding the factors that drive property prices in Singapore is both economically and socially relevant in the backdrop of rising property prices globally.\nDespite the government’s interventions to maintain affordability and market stability, price dynamics continue to vary significantly across regions, flat types, and lease duration. The government has continuously implemented ‘cooling measures’ in multiple attempts to suppress the growth of housing prices. While prices continue to climb, the pace has moderated from the peak. Some also say that the pace have not slowed down.\nSome examples of ‘cooling measures’ - Increasing taxes on buyers with more than one property, increasing tax on sellers who buy and resell properties.\nEven after these cooling measures, new records have been hit in 2025.\nHDB: 415 resale flats sold for over SGD1M (USD770K) in the second quarter of 2025 alone, and the total number of such transactions for 2025 is on track to exceed 1,500.\nPrivate: Core Central Region (CCR): S$2,612 psf (~USD1.4M for an average 2 bedroom at 700sqft) Rest of Central Region (RCR): S$2,499 psf (~USD1.35M for an average 2 bedroom at 700sqft) Outside Central Region (OCR): ~$2,110 psf (~USD1.15M for an average 2 bedroom at 700sqft)\nWe are excluding landed properties as they are only purchasable by Singapore citizens, and prices are pre-tax.\nProperty market is too hot!",
