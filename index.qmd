# Introduction
Singapore's property market is an extremely interesting case study due to its unique characteristics and the government's active role in regulating it. Roughly 8 in 10 Singaporeans live in public housing known as Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats, which are subsidized apartments sold on a 99-year leasehold basis. This system was established to provide quality housing at an affordable price for the majority of the population, a goal it has generally accomplished over the years, with over an over 90% home ownership rate in Singapore. However, despite the government's efforts to maintain affordability and market stability, price dynamics continue to vary significantly across regions, flat types, and lease duration, leading to ongoing debates about housing affordability. Our project aims to analyze the factors influencing HDB resale prices, analyzing the general trend of rising prices, the impact of location, flat type, and lease duration on resale prices, and the various geopolitical and policy factors that have influenced these trends over time.
