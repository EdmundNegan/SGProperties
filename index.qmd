# Introduction
Singapore's property market is an extremely interesting case study due to its unique characteristics and the government's active role in regulating it. Roughly 8 in 10 Singaporeans live in public housing known as Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats, which are subsidized apartments sold on a 99-year leasehold basis. This system was established to provide quality housing at an affordable price for the majority of the population, a goal it has generally accomplished over the years, with over an over 90% home ownership rate in Singapore. However, despite the government's efforts to maintain affordability and market stability, price dynamics continue to vary significantly across regions, flat types, and lease duration, leading to ongoing debates about housing affordability. Our project aims to analyze the factors influencing HDB resale prices, analyzing the general trend of rising prices, the impact of location, flat type, and lease duration on resale prices, and the various geopolitical and policy factors that have influenced these trends over time.

For a reader who is unfamiliar with Singapore’s housing system, we will contrast it with New York City (NYC). While NYC is a global metropolis with a predominantly market-driven housing market, where only about 4% of units are public housing. Singapore is almost the opposite: approximately 80% of resident households live in HDB public flats. This means that Singapore’s resale market plays a far larger economic and social role than the resale of public units in New York. Moreover, unlike NYC homes, Singapore’s HDB flats are sold on 99-year leases, creating measurable “lease decay” that affects resale prices. These structural differences explain why our analysis focuses on public housing data and why patterns such as location premiums, million-dollar flats, and lease-related depreciation emerge so clearly in Singapore, but not in markets like New York. In Singapore, public housing is the norm. In NYC, public housing is the safety net.
