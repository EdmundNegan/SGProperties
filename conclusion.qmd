# Conclusion
This project has provided a deep dive into the factors influencing resale prices in the Singapore HDB market. By analysing various features such as location, flat type, flat area, remaining lease, and storey height, we illustrated how these elements contribute to the overall pricing dynamics. Our exploratory data analysis revealed significant trends and patterns, notably the premium associated with certain locations and flat types. Notably, location emerged as a critical determinant of resale prices, an analysis that is further confirmed by contextual knowledge of Singapore's MOP policy resulting in a spike in flats sold around with around 90 years of remaining lease. Limitations of the study include the absence of more granular data on flat conditions and amenities such as the flat's interior condition or proximity to public transport and schools, all of which could further refine price predictions. Future research could incorporate these additional variables and explore advanced modeling techniques to develop a model that can accurately predict resale prices based on a comprehensive set of features. Overall, this project underscores the complexity of the HDB resale market and highlights the importance of multifaceted analysis in understanding real estate pricing trends and we learnt the importance of data cleaning and preprocessing in ensuring the reliability of our findings.
